class IDisconnectable:
    """
    A class that provides automatic resource cleanup for GTK widgets and other objects.

    This class manages three types of resources that need cleanup:
    - GTK signals (stored in self.signals)
    - Data bindings (stored in self.bindings)
    - Child disconnectable widgets (stored in self.disconnectables)

    Usage:
    ------
    1. Inherit from IDisconnectable alongside your main class:

    >>> class MyWidget(Gtk.Box, IDisconnectable):
    ...    def __init__(self):
    ...        Gtk.Box.__init__(self)
    ...        IDisconnectable.__init__(self)

    2. When connecting signals, store them in self.signals as a tuple of the object
        and the handler id:

    >>> self.signals.append((
    ...     some_object,
    ...     some_object.connect("signal-name", callback)))

    3. When creating bindings, store them in self.bindings:

    >>> self.bindings.append(some_binding_object.bind_property(...))

    4. When creating child widgets that are also IDisconnectable, store them:

    >>> child_widget = SomeDisconnectableWidget()
    ... self.disconnectables.append(child_widget)

    5. Call disconnect_all() when the widget is being destroyed:
    """
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.signals = []
        self.bindings = []
        self.disconnectables = []

    def disconnect_all(self, *_args) -> None:
        """Disconnects all signals so that the class can be deleted"""

        for obj, signal_id in self.signals:
            if obj.handler_is_connected(signal_id):
                obj.disconnect(signal_id)
        del self.signals

        for binding in self.bindings:
            try:
                binding.unbind()
            except Exception:
                pass
        del self.bindings

        for widget in self.disconnectables:
            try:
                widget.disconnect_all()
            except Exception:
                pass
        del self.disconnectables

        self.signals = []
        self.bindings = []
        self.disconnectables = []

    # def __del__(self):
    #     print(f"DELETING {self}")
